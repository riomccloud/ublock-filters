# uBlock filters
My personal list of uBlock Origin's filters, made with the purpose of debloating the web and improving user experience. Some were made to work together with [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector)'s rules, look at them on the correspondent items.

## Installation
1. Copy the raw file URL(s) of the filter(s) you want to use
2. Open uBlock Origin's settings, go to "Filters lists" tab, roll down to "Import..." and paste the URLs, one per line
3. (Optional) Install the Redirector web browser extension and setup the suggested redirect rules
